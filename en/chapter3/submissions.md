#Chapter 3: Dashboard
## Submissions

This page provides information about submissions. 

Unassigned includes new submissions that do not yet have an editor or section editor. These typically need immediate attention by an editor.

My Assigned includes submissions that have come in and have been assigned to you.

My Authored include your own submissions to the press.

Each submission is listed with its unique identification number, its title, the initials of the assigned editor, and the stage that the submission is currently in (submission, review, copyediting, production).

In front of each submission is a toggle, which allows you to see links to delete the submission or to get more information, including its history and notes.

Each section provides a search tool, available by selecting the magnifying glass icon. Searching is available by title or author. You can limit searches to specific stages.

The New Submission button allows you to start a new submission to the press.
