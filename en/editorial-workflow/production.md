# Editorial Workflow
## Production

In the Production stage, the editor assigns production assistants to the submission.

**Production Ready Files**: All files sent by the editor for production are listed here.

Use the *Search* tool if there are several files.

Use the *Upload File* tool to add any additional files for consideration.

Use the toggle next to the file name to reveal *More Information* and *Delete* links:

* *More Information* provides the editorial history of the file.
* *Delete* allows you to delete the file.

**Participants**: Includes the names of all users involved in the editorial process.

Use the *Add* link to add a new participant to the list, such as a production assistant.

Use the toggle next to the user's name to reveal links to *Remove* or *Notify* the user.

**Production Discussions**: Allows you to communicate with other participants involved with the editorial workflow for this submission.

Use the *Add Discussion* link to initiate a new discussion.

You will need to choose the recipients, add a subject line, and compose a message. You also have the option of attaching a file. Hit the *OK* button to create the discussion and inform the recipients.

**Publication Formats**: The final production files are listed here.

Use the *Add Publication Format* link to create a new format.

Once the publication formats are all in place, create a new catalog entry (see Catalog Entry above for details) to have the submission appear on the website.
