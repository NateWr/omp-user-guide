#OMP 1.2 User Guide

This guide will help you publish monographs, books and edited volumes with Open Monograph Press.

It provides an introductory overview for each stage of the workflow from submission to production. It also provides further background information on some of the configuration options.

When you see **Help** links within the application, they'll open a help panel with the most useful information for that section.
