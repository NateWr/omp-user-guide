# Chapter 6: Settings
## Site Access Options

Customize how users can access your web site.

**Additional Site and Content Access Restrictions**: Use the checkboxes to determine any limits on accessing the web site or open access content. Typically these are left unchecked, but in rare circumstances you may wish to require registration.

**User Registration**: Determine whether users can self-enroll on the web site. Allowing authors and reviewers to self-enroll can save the Press Manager significant time in user creation.

Select the **Save** button to record any changes.
