## User Management

This page allows you to manage your user list.

**Current Users**: provides a list of all users registered with the press.

Use the toggle next to the user first name to reveal links to Email, Edit User, Disable, Remove, Login As, and Merge User.

**Email**: Send an email to that user.

**Edit User**: Modify the user's profile.

**Disable**: Block the user from logging into the system.

**Remove**: Remove the user from all roles within the system.

**Login As**: Temporarily login as that user and perform any outstanding tasks.

**Merge User**: When a user has two accounts, use this feature to merge them into one.

**Search**: Allows you to search for a user, including the ability to limit by role.

**Find all users in a role**: To find a list of all authors, use the search tool, but leave the search field blank. Select the role (e.g., author) and hit Search. This will display all authors in the press.

**Add User**: Allows you to create a new user. You will need to provide their name, email, and country -- and create their username and password.
