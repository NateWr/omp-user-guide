# Chapter 6: Settings
## Roles

This page allows you to customize the roles used by your press.

**Current Roles**: Displays a list of default roles included with the system. Use the checkboxes to determine whether users in that role can access the different workflow stages.

Use the toggle next to the role name to reveal an *Edit* link, allowing you to make further changes. You will also see a *Remove* link, allowing you to remove that role from your press.

To create a new role, use the *Create New Role* link. You will need to indicate whether the new role should have similar permissions to:

* Authors: can only submit
* Reviewers: can only review 
* Readers: can only access content, not workflow
* Press Managers: can access complete workflow
* Series Editors: can access selected stages in workflow
* Press Assistants: can access limited stages in workflow

You will also need to provide a Role Name, a Role Abbreviation (e.g., Reviewer = REV), which stages they can access, and different role options.
