## Roles

This page allows you to customize the roles used by your press.

**Current Roles**: Displays a list of default roles included with the system. Use the checkboxes to determine whether users in that role can access the different workflow stages.

Use the toggle next to the role name to reveal an *Edit* link, allowing you to make further changes. You will also see a *Remove* link, allowing you to remove that role from your press.

To create a new role, use the *Create New Role* link. You will need to indicate whether the new role should have similar permissions to Authors, Reviewers, Readers, Press Managers, Series Editors, or Press Assistants.

You will also need to provide a Role Name, a Role Abbreviation (e.g., Reviewer = REV), which stages they can access, and different role options.
