## Components

Your publications can consist of a number of components, including a book-length manuscript or a chapter-length manuscript, as well as illustrations, glossary, index, etc.

In the workflow, each file uploaded to the system needs to identified as a particular component.

This list provides an initial list of common components, but you are free to delete, modify, or add more, depending on the particular needs of your press.

Use the toggle next to the component name to reveal an *Edit* link to make modifications.

Use the *Order* link to re-order how the components are displayed.

Use the *Add a Component* link to add a new one.

Use the *Restore Defaults* link to destroy any customizations and return to the original set of components.

When adding a new component, you will be asked for some basic information:

**Name**: Provide a simple, recognizable name for the component (e.g., glossary).

**Designation**: ??

**Options**: Chose the best options for your new component. These will control how your new components are displayed.

File Type Grouping: From the menu, choose whether your new component is primarily a document, artwork, or a supplementary file.
