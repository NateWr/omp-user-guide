## Submission

This page allows you to modify the submission process.

**Submission Preparation Checklist**: This checklist will be displayed on the press web site as well as to authors making their submission.

Using the toggle next to the checklist item, you will see an *Edit* link, allowing you to modify the item, and a *Delete* link, allowing you to remove the item.

Use the *Order* link to re-order the checklist items.

Use the *Add Item* link to add a new checklist item.

**Notification of Author Submission**: On completing a submission, authors automatically receive an acknowledgement email (which can be viewed and edited in Prepared Emails). 

Enabling the checkbox, a copy of the acknowledgement email can also be sent to the email address added to the box.

**Submission Metadata**: The system provides an extensive set of submission data. You can enable each metadata item using the checkboxes.

Checking *Entered on Submission* will make the selected metadata fields visible for submitting authors.

Checking *Entered in Workflow* will make the selected metadata fields only available to editors when preparing the submission for publication. This can simplify the submission process for the authors.

*Checking both* will make those fields available to both authors and editors.

*Unchecking both* will hide those fields from both the author and editors, effectively eliminating them from your workflow.

Select the **Save** button to record your changes.
