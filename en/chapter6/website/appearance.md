# Chapter 6: Settings
## Appearance

Use this page to customize the appearance of your press web site.

**Press Logo**: Use the Upload button to add a logo for the press. The recommended dimensions are 200px X 200px.

To comply with WCAG standards, be sure to enter Alternative Text that describes the image (usually the name of the press) when requested during upload. 

Note that most themes will display the press's name in the header if no logo has been uploaded.

**Press Page Footer**: Enter any images, text or HTML code that you'd like to appear at the bottom of your press's website.

**Theme**: Select a theme for your website. New themes may be added in the plugins setup area.

**Press style sheet**: Experienced web developers can upload a CSS file to further customize the website's appearance.

**Homepage image**: Upload an image to display prominently on the press homepage.

**Homepage Content**: Use the following checkboxes to enable changes to your press web site:

* Display books in the spotlight on the home page
* Display featured books on the home page
* Display new releases on the home page

**Additional Content**: Add any additional content you'd like to appear on the homepage.

**Order of monographs**: Choose how to order the books in the catalog.

**Lists**: Limit the number of items to show in a list per page (for example, submissions, users, or editing assignments). 

For example, if you enter 50 *pages per item*, a list of 500 items would appear over 10 pages (50 per page).

From here you can also set the number of links to display to more pages of the list.

For example, if you enter 3 *page links*, a list of 500 items would be navigated with "1 - 2 - 3 - more" links.

**Cover Thumbnails**: Cover thumbnails are small images of your book covers. Use these fields to set the maximum width and height of the cover thumbnails. 

They will be automatically resized when they are larger than these settings but will not be enlarged if they are smaller. The images will never be stretched to fit these dimensions.
