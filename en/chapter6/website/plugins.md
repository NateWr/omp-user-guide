## Plugins

Plugins provide extensions to the core functionality of the system.

This list of **Installed Plugins** shows the name, description, and whether the plugin is enabled.

Some plugins are required and cannot be disabled.

The **Plugin Gallery** displays plugins that are not included with the system but can be added.
