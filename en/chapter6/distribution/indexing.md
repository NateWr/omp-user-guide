## Indexing

**Search Engine Indexing**: To improve your visibility in search engines, provide a brief description of the press.

**Custom Tags**: Custom HTML header tags can be added to the header of every page (e.g., META tags). Leave this field blank if you are unfamiliar with using HTML header tags.

**Register Press for Indexing (Metadata Harvesting)**: This system is compliant with Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting (OAI-PMH). This will allow you to register your press with various OAI-PMH repositories *once you have published content*. 

The [PKP Index](http://index.pkp.sfu.ca) is one such repository that will help you share your content with the world.
