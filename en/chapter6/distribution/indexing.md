Register Press for Indexing (Metadata Harvesting)

To have the contents of this press indexed within a globally distributed system of research databases, register your press URL with the Public Knowledge Project metadata harvester. This tool collects the metadata from each indexed item in this press, enabling accurate and collective searching among the research sites that adhere to the Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting. 

Note that if your site administrator has already registered this site with the PKP Harvester, your press will be indexed automatically and you do not need to register your press.
