## Create Press

To create a press, add the following information:

**Press Name**: Select a unique name for your press (e.g., Simon Fraser University Press).

**Press description**: Provide a brief description of your new press.

**Path**: Add a one word term, such as an abbreviation of your press name (e.g., sfup). This will be the suffix of your URL (e.g., http://omp.sfu.ca/index.php/sfup).

Use the "Enable this press to appear publicly on the site" checkbox to make your press visible on the web site.

Select the **Save** button to record your changes and create the press.

You will automatically be enrolled as the manager of this new press.

After creating the new press, you will be redirected to its settings wizard, to complete the basic press setup.
