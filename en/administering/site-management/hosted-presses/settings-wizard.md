## Settings Wizard

The Settings Wizard walks you through the basic press setup steps.

These include the Masthead, Contact, Appearance, Submission, Indexing, and Users.

This can be done by the administrator or headed over to a press manager or senior editor to complete.

See Chapter 6 for details on these steps.
