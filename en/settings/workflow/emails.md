# Settings
## Emails

This page allows you to customize the email communication used by the system.

**Email Header**: The prepared emails sent by the system on behalf of the press will begin with the header displayed in the textbox.

These emails will be addressed from the Principal Contact, so it's important to clarify that the Primary Contact is not necessarily responsible for the message content, which may be sent on behalf of a different user.

**Signature**: The prepared emails sent by the system on behalf of the press will have the signature in the textbox added to the end.

**Bounce Address**: Any undeliverable emails will result in an error message to this address.

Note: To activate this option, the site administrator must enable the allow_envelope_sender option in the OMP configuration file. 

Additional server configuration may be required to support this functionality (which may not be possible on all servers).

**Prepared Email Templates**: Automated, pre-written emails are an important part of the system. The following are a list of prepared emails used by the system.

Using the toggle next to the prepared email name, you can see the *Edit Email* link (to edit the content) and *Reset* link (to destroy any previous changes and restore the system default).

Use the *Add Email Template* to add a new prepared email.

Use the *Reset All Templates* to destroy all changes previously made to the emails and restore the system defaults.
