# Chapter 9: Authoring
## Upload

From this page, you will be able to upload your submission files. In some cases, you may only have one file to submit (e.g., a manuscript), and in others you may have multiple files (e.g., manuscript, spreadsheet, images, etc.).

Each file must be uploaded separately.

In Step 1, select the File Component using the menu. This tells the system what type of file you are uploading (e.g., Book Manuscript, Photo, etc.).

You can then upload the file, either by dragging and dropping or using the file upload tool.

Select **Continue** to proceed.
