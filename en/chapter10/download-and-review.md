# Chapter 10: Reviewing
## Download & Review

In this step, you will conduct your review.

**Download**: From here, you can download the file. In some cases, there may be only a single file to review, and in others there may be multiple.

Open the files on your desktop and do your review.

**Review**: Paste your review comments in the textbox. The first box will be visible to both the editor and the author, so be careful with your wording.

The second box is only for the editor, so your comments may be a bit more candid.

Note: Some presses may replace these blank text boxes with specific questions for you to fill in.

**Upload**: In addition to adding your comments, you also have the option of uploading a copy of the submission manuscript that include your edits (e.g., track changes).

Be sure that you don't add any identifying information to the revised manuscript. That would undermine the blind peer review process.

Once you've made your comments, select the **Submit Review** button to proceed.
