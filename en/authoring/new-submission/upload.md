## Upload

From this page, you will be able to upload your submission files. In some cases, you may only have one file to submit (e.g., a manuscript), and in others you may have multiple files (e.g., manuscript, spreadsheet, images, etc.).

Each file must be uploaded separately.

In Step 1, select the File Component using the menu. This tells the system what type of file you are uploading (e.g., Book Manuscript, Photo, etc.).

You can then upload the file, either by dragging and dropping or using the file upload tool.

Select **Continue** to proceed.

In Step 2, you must name the file (e.g., Book Manuscript, or Photo 1). This will provide you and the editors an easy way to identify this file as it goes through the workflow. Do not include your name, as this file name will be visible to reviewers.

You have the option of adding comments to the Note field. This note will be visible to everyone involved in the submission process, including editors, reviewers, copyeditors, etc.

Select **Continue** to proceed.

In Step 3, you can add another file, such as another photo, or select the **Complete** button to finish uploading files.

Your uploaded files are now visible in the **Submission Files** table.

Select **Save and Continue** to proceed.
