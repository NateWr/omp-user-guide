# Chapter 5: Editorial Workflow
## Internal Review

In the Internal Review stage, the editor assigns internal reviewers to the submission.

By default, you are placed in *Round 1* of reviews. If major changes are required, Round 2 may be initiated.

**Review Files**: All files sent by the editor for internal review are listed here.

Use the *Search* tool if there are several files.

Use the *Upload File* tool to add any additional files for consideration.

Use the toggle next to the file name to reveal *More Information* and *Delete* links:

* *More Information* provides the editorial history of the file.
* *Delete* allows you to delete the file.
