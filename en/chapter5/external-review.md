# Chapter 5: Editorial Workflow
## External Review

In the External Review stage, the editor assigns external reviewers to the submission.

By default, you are placed in *Round 1* of reviews. If major changes are required, Round 2 may be initiated.

**Review Files**: All files sent by the editor for external review are listed here.

Use the *Search* tool if there are several files.

Use the *Upload/Select Files* tool to add any additional files for consideration.

Use the toggle next to the file name to reveal *More Information* and *Delete* links:

* *More Information* provides the editorial history of the file.
* *Delete* allows you to delete the file.

**Reviewers**: A list of all internal reviewers for this submission. Use the *Add Reviewer* link to add reviewers. 

You can locate a reviewer by searching or selecting from a list.

Reviewer comments will be available from this table as they come in.

**Revisions**: A list of all revisions to the submission. 

The *Search* tool allows you to find files in a long list.

The *Upload File* link allows you to add revised files to the list.

**Review Discussions**: Allows you to communicate with other participants involved with the editorial workflow for this submission.

Use the *Add Discussion* link to initiate a new discussion.

You will need to choose the recipients, add a subject line, and compose a message. You also have the option of attaching a file. Hit the *OK* button to create the discussion and inform the recipients.
