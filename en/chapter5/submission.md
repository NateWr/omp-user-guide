# Chapter 5: Editorial Workflow
## Submission

On the Submission page, the editor decides whether a new submission should proceed on to review and possible publication.

**Submission Files**: All files uploaded by the author are listed here.

Use the *Search* tool if there are several files.

Use the *Upload File* tool to add any additional files for consideration.

Use the toggle next to the file name to reveal *More Information*, *Edit Metadata*, and *Delete* links:

* *More Information* provides the editorial history of the file.
* *Edit Metadata* allows you to modify the metadata of the file.
* *Delete* allows you to delete the file.

**Pre-Review Discussions**: Allow you to communicate with other participants involved with the editorial workflow for this submission.

Use the *Add Discussion* link to initiate a new discussion. You will need to choose the recipients, add a subject line, and compose a message. You also have the option of attaching a file. Hit the *OK* button to create the discussion and inform the recipients.
